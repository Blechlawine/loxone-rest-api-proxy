# Loxone Rest API Proxy

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `cargo install --path .`
3. Run `loxone-rest-api-proxy`

## Why does this exist?

Loxone miniservers respond with xml on their api, which might be difficult to work with. So this proxy provides a simple way to convert the xml to json.
